# Installation Â· Get Started with Nuxt
Get started with Nuxt quickly with our online starters or start locally with your terminal.

If you just want to play around with Nuxt in your browser without setting up a project, you can use one of our online sandboxes:

Or follow the steps below to set up a new Nuxt project on your computer.

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

*   **Node.js** - [`18.x`](https://nodejs.org/en) or newer (but we recommend the [active LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule))
*   **Text editor** - There is no IDE requirement, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [official Vue extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously known as Volar) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), which, along with [other JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/), offers great Nuxt support right out-of-the-box.
*   **Terminal** - In order to run Nuxt commands

Additional notes for an optimal setup:

*   **Node.js**: Make sure to use an even numbered version (18, 20, etc)
*   **Nuxtr**: Install the community-developed [Nuxtr extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxtr.nuxtr-vscode)
*   **WSL**: If you're using Windows, we recommend using [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with a distribution like Ubuntu for a better developer performance.

Open a terminal (if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

```
npm create nuxt <project-name>

```


Alternatively, you can find other starters or themes by opening

[nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new/)

and following the instructions there.

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code:

Terminal

```
code <project-name>

```


Or change directory into your new project from your terminal:

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

Well done! A browser window should automatically open for

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

.

Now that you've created your Nuxt project, you are ready to start building your application.
