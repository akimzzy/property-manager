# SEO and Meta Â· Get Started with Nuxt

Nuxt head tag management is powered by [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/). It provides sensible defaults, several powerful composables and numerous configuration options to manage your app's head and SEO meta tags.

Providing an [`app.head`](about:/docs/api/nuxt-config#head) property in your [`nuxt.config.ts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) allows you to statically customize the head for your entire app.

This method does not allow you to provide reactive data. We recommend to use `useHead()` in `app.vue`.

It's good practice to set tags here that won't change such as your site title default, language and favicon.

nuxt.config.ts

```
export default
defineNuxtConfig({

app: {

head: {

title: 'Nuxt', // default fallback title

htmlAttrs: {

lang: 'en',
      },

link: [
        {
rel: 'icon',
type: 'image/x-icon',
href: '/favicon.ico' },
      ]
    }
  }
})

```

You can also provide any of the keys listed below in [Types](#types).

### [Defaults Tags](#defaults-tags)

Some tags are provided by Nuxt by default to ensure your website works well out of the box.

- `viewport`: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`
- `charset`: `utf-8`

While most sites won't need to override these defaults, you can update them using the keyed shortcuts.

nuxt.config.ts

```
export default
defineNuxtConfig({

app: {

head: {
      // update Nuxt defaults

charset: 'utf-16',

viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1',
    }
  }
})

```

The [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) composable function supports reactive input, allowing you to manage your head tags programmatically.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({

title: 'My App',

meta: [
    {
name: 'description',
content: 'My amazing site.' }
  ],

bodyAttrs: {

class: 'test'
  },

script: [ {
innerHTML: 'console.log(\'Hello world\')' } ]
})
</script>

```

We recommend to take a look at the [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) and [`useHeadSafe`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head-safe) composables.

The [`useSeoMeta`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-seo-meta) composable lets you define your site's SEO meta tags as an object with full type safety.

This helps you avoid typos and common mistakes, such as using `name` instead of `property`.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useSeoMeta({

title: 'My Amazing Site',

ogTitle: 'My Amazing Site',

description: 'This is my amazing site, let me tell you all about it.',

ogDescription: 'This is my amazing site, let me tell you all about it.',

ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',

twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
</script>

```

While using [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) is recommended in all cases, you may have a personal preference for defining your head tags in your template using components.

Nuxt provides the following components for this purpose: `<Title>`, `<Base>`, `<NoScript>`, `<Style>`, `<Meta>`, `<Link>`, `<Body>`, `<Html>` and `<Head>`. Note the capitalization of these components ensuring we don't use invalid native HTML tags.

`<Head>` and `<Body>` can accept nested meta tags (for aesthetic reasons) but this does not affect _where_ the nested meta tags are rendered in the final HTML.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const title = ref('Hello World')
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <Head>
      <Title>{{ title }}</Title>
      <Meta name="description" :content="title" />
      <Style type="text/css">
      body { background-color: green; }
      </Style>
    </Head>

    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

```

It's suggested to wrap your components in either a `<Head>` or `<Html>` components as tags will be deduped more intuitively.

Below are the non-reactive types used for [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head), [`app.head`](about:/docs/api/nuxt-config#head) and components.

```
interface MetaObject {
  title?: string
  titleTemplate?: string | ((title?: string) => string)
  templateParams?: Record<string, string | Record<string, string>>
  base?: Base
  link?: Link[]
  meta?: Meta[]
  style?: Style[]
  script?: Script[]
  noscript?: Noscript[];
  htmlAttrs?: HtmlAttributes;
  bodyAttrs?: BodyAttributes;
}

```

See [@unhead/vue](https://github.com/unjs/unhead/blob/main/packages/vue/src/types/schema.ts) for more detailed types.

### [Reactivity](#reactivity)

Reactivity is supported on all properties, by providing a computed value, a getter, or a reactive object.

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const
description =
ref('My amazing site.')


useHead({

meta: [
    {
name: 'description',
content:
description }
  ],
})
</script>

```

### [Title Template](#title-template)

You can use the `titleTemplate` option to provide a dynamic template for customizing the title of your site. For example, you could add the name of your site to the title of every page.

The `titleTemplate` can either be a string, where `%s` is replaced with the title, or a function.

If you want to use a function (for full control), then this cannot be set in your `nuxt.config`. It is recommended instead to set it within your `app.vue` file where it will apply to all pages on your site:

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({

titleTemplate: (
titleChunk) => {
    return
titleChunk ? `${
titleChunk} - Site Title` : 'Site Title';
  }
})
</script>

```

Now, if you set the title to `My Page` with [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) on another page of your site, the title would appear as 'My Page - Site Title' in the browser tab. You could also pass `null` to default to 'Site Title'.

### [Body Tags](#body-tags)

You can use the `tagPosition: 'bodyClose'` option on applicable tags to append them to the end of the `<body>` tag.

For example:

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({

script: [
    {

src: 'https://third-party-script.com',
      // valid options are: 'head' | 'bodyClose' | 'bodyOpen'

tagPosition: 'bodyClose'
    }
  ]
})
</script>

```

### [With `definePageMeta`](#with-definepagemeta)

Within your [`pages/` directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages), you can use `definePageMeta` along with [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) to set metadata based on the current route.

For example, you can first set the current page title (this is extracted at build time via a macro, so it can't be set dynamically):

pages/some-page.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">

definePageMeta({

title: 'Some Page'
})
</script>

```

And then in your layout file, you might use the route's metadata you have previously set:

layouts/default.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const
route =
useRoute()


useHead({

meta: [{
property: 'og:title',
content: `App Name - ${
route.
meta.
title}` }]
})
</script>

```

Read more in Docs > Guide > Directory Structure > Pages > #page Metadata.

### [Dynamic Title](#dynamic-title)

In the example below, `titleTemplate` is set either as a string with the `%s` placeholder or as a `function`, which allows greater flexibility in setting the page title dynamically for each route of your Nuxt app:

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({
  // as a string,
  // where `%s` is replaced with the title

titleTemplate: '%s - Site Title',
})
</script>

```

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({
  // or as a function

titleTemplate: (
productCategory) => {
    return productCategory
      ? `${
productCategory} - Site Title`
      : 'Site Title'
  }
})
</script>

```

`nuxt.config` is also used as an alternative way of setting the page title. However, `nuxt.config` does not allow the page title to be dynamic. Therefore, it is recommended to use `titleTemplate` in the `app.vue` file to add a dynamic title, which is then applied to all routes of your Nuxt app.

### [External CSS](#external-css)

The example below shows how you might enable Google Fonts using either the `link` property of the [`useHead`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head) composable or using the `<Link>` component:

```
<script setup lang="ts">

useHead({

link: [
    {

rel: 'preconnect',

href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'
    },
    {

rel: 'stylesheet',

href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap',

crossorigin: ''
    }
  ]
})
</script>

```
