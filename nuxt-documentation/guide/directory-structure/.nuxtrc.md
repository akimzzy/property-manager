The .nuxtrc file allows you to define nuxt configurations in a flat syntax.

The `.nuxtrc` file can be used to configure Nuxt with a flat syntax. It is based on [`unjs/rc9`](https://github.com/unjs/rc9).

For more advanced configurations, use

[`nuxt.config`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config)

.

.nuxtrc

```
# Disable SSR
ssr=false

# Configuration for `@nuxt/devtools`
devtools.enabled=true

# Add Nuxt modules
modules[]=@nuxt/image
modules[]=nuxt-security

```


If present, the properties in the `nuxt.config` file will overwrite the properties in `.nuxtrc` file.

Discover all the available options in the **Nuxt configuration** documentation.

You can also create a global `.nuxtrc` file in your home directory to apply configurations globally.

*   On macOS/Linux, this file is located at:
*   On Windows, it is located at:
    
    ```
C:\Users\{username}\.nuxtrc

```

    

This global `.nuxtrc` file allows you to define default settings that apply to all Nuxt projects on your system. However, project-level `.nuxtrc` files will override these global settings, and `nuxt.config` will take precedence over both.
