# .output/ Â· Nuxt Directory Structure

[Nuxt UI Pro v3 is out! Get 20% OFF until Friday](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing)

Nuxt creates the .output/ directory when building your application for production.

This directory should be added to your

[`.gitignore`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/gitignore)

file to avoid pushing the build output to your repository.

Use this directory to deploy your Nuxt application to production.

Read more in Docs > Getting Started > Deployment.

You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running

[`nuxt build`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/build)
