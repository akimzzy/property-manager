[Nuxt UI Pro v3 is out! Get 20% OFF until Friday](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing)

The assets/ directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool will process.

The directory usually contains the following types of files:

- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the [`public/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.

If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the [`public/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.
