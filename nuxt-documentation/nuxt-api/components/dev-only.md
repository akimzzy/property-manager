<template>
  <div>
    <Sidebar />
    <DevOnly>
      <!-- this component will only be rendered during development -->

      <!-- if you ever require to have a replacement during production -->
      <!-- be sure to test these using `nuxt preview` -->
      <template #fallback>
        <div><!-- empty div for flex.justify-between --></div>
