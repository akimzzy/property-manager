# $fetch Â· Nuxt Utils
Nuxt uses [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) to expose globally the `$fetch` helper for making HTTP requests within your Vue app or API routes.

During server-side rendering, calling `$fetch` to fetch your internal

[API routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server)

will directly call the relevant function (emulating the request), **saving an additional API call**.

Using `$fetch` in components without wrapping it with

[`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data)

causes fetching the data twice: initially on the server, then again on the client-side during hydration, because `$fetch` does not transfer state from the server to the client. Thus, the fetch will be executed on both sides because the client has to get the data again.

We recommend to use [`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) or [`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data) + `$fetch` to prevent double data fetching when fetching the component data.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
// During SSR data is fetched twice, once on the server and once on the client.
const dataTwice = await $fetch('/api/item')

// During SSR data is fetched only on the server side and transferred to the client.
const { data } = await useAsyncData('item', () => $fetch('/api/item'))

// You can also useFetch as shortcut of useAsyncData + $fetch
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/item')
</script>

```

You can use `$fetch` in any methods that are executed only on client-side.

pages/contact.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
function contactForm() {
  $fetch('/api/contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: { hello: 'world '}
  })
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="contactForm">Contact</button>
</template>

```


`$fetch` is the preferred way to make HTTP calls in Nuxt instead of

[@nuxt/http](https://github.com/nuxt/http)

and

[@nuxtjs/axios](https://github.com/nuxt-community/axios-module)

that are made for Nuxt 2.

If you use `$fetch` to call an (external) HTTPS URL with a self-signed certificate in development, you will need to set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in your environment.

### [Passing Headers and Cookies](#passing-headers-and-cookies)

When we call `$fetch` in the browser, user headers like `cookie` will be directly sent to the API.

However, during Server-Side Rendering, due to security risks such as **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** or **Authentication Misuse**, the `$fetch` wouldn't include the user's browser cookies, nor pass on cookies from the fetch response.

```
<script setup lang="ts">
// This will NOT forward headers or cookies during SSR
const { data } = await useAsyncData(() => $fetch('/api/cookies'))
</script>

```


If you need to forward headers and cookies on the server, you must manually pass them:

pages/index.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
// This will forward the user's headers and cookies to `/api/cookies`
const requestFetch = useRequestFetch()
const { data } = await useAsyncData(() => requestFetch('/api/cookies'))
</script>

```


However, when calling `useFetch` with a relative URL on the server, Nuxt will use [`useRequestFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-request-fetch) to proxy headers and cookies (with the exception of headers not meant to be forwarded, like `host`).
