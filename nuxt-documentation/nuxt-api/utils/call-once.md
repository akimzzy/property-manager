# callOnce Â· Nuxt Utils

Run a given function or block of code once during SSR or CSR.

This utility is available since

[Nuxt v3.9](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-9)

.

The `callOnce` function is designed to execute a given function or block of code only once during:

- server-side rendering but not hydration
- client-side navigation

This is useful for code that should be executed only once, such as logging an event or setting up a global state.

The default mode of `callOnce` is to run code only once. For example, if the code runs on the server it won't run again on the client. It also won't run again if you `callOnce` more than once on the client, for example by navigating back to this page.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const websiteConfig = useState('config')

await callOnce(async () => {
  console.log('This will only be logged once')
  websiteConfig.value = await $fetch('https://my-cms.com/api/website-config')
})
</script>

```

It is also possible to run on every navigation while still avoiding the initial server/client double load. For this, it is possible to use the `navigation` mode:

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const websiteConfig = useState('config')

await callOnce(async () => {
  console.log('This will only be logged once and then on every client side navigation')
  websiteConfig.value = await $fetch('https://my-cms.com/api/website-config')
}, { mode: 'navigation' })
</script>

```

`navigation` mode is available since

[Nuxt v3.15](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15)

.

`callOnce` is useful in combination with the

[Pinia module](https://nuxt.com/modules/pinia)

to call store actions.

Note that `callOnce` doesn't return anything. You should use

[`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data)

or

[`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch)

if you want to do data fetching during SSR.

`callOnce` is a composable meant to be called directly in a setup function, plugin, or route middleware, because it needs to add data to the Nuxt payload to avoid re-calling the function on the client when the page hydrates.

```
callOnce (key?: string, fn?: (() => any | Promise<any>), options?: CallOnceOptions): Promise<void>
callOnce(fn?: (() => any | Promise<any>), options?: CallOnceOptions): Promise<void>

type CallOnceOptions = {
  /**
   * Execution mode for the callOnce function
   * @default 'render'
   */
  mode?: 'navigation' | 'render'
}

```

- `key`: A unique key ensuring that the code is run once. If you do not provide a key, then a key that is unique to the file and line number of the instance of `callOnce` will be generated for you.
- `fn`: The function to run once. This function can also return a `Promise` and a value.
- `options`: Setup the mode, either to re-execute on navigation (`navigation`) or just once for the lifetime of the app (`render`). Defaults to `render`.
  - `render`: Executes once during initial render (either SSR or CSR) - Default mode
  - `navigation`: Executes once during initial render and once per subsequent client-side navigation
