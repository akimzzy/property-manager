# useSeoMeta Â· Nuxt Composables
This helps you avoid common mistakes, such as using `name` instead of `property`, as well as typos - with over 100+ meta tags fully typed.

This is the recommended way to add meta tags to your site as it is XSS safe and has full TypeScript support.

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
useSeoMeta({
  title: 'My Amazing Site',
  ogTitle: 'My Amazing Site',
  description: 'This is my amazing site, let me tell you all about it.',
  ogDescription: 'This is my amazing site, let me tell you all about it.',
  ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image',
})
</script>

```


When inserting tags that are reactive, you should use the computed getter syntax (`() => value`):

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const title = ref('My title')

useSeoMeta({
  title,
  description: () => `This is a description for the ${title.value} page`
})
</script>

```


There are over 100 parameters. See the [full list of parameters in the source code](https://github.com/harlan-zw/zhead/blob/main/packages/zhead/src/metaFlat.ts#L1035).

In most instances, SEO meta tags don't need to be reactive as search engine robots primarily scan the initial page load.

For better performance, you can wrap your `useSeoMeta` calls in a server-only condition when the meta tags don't need to be reactive:

app.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
if (import.meta.server) {
  // These meta tags will only be added during server-side rendering
  useSeoMeta({
    robots: 'index, follow',
    description: 'Static description that does not need reactivity',
    ogImage: 'https://example.com/image.png',
    // other static meta tags...
  })
}

const dynamicTitle = ref('My title')
// Only use reactive meta tags outside the condition when necessary
useSeoMeta({
  title: () => dynamicTitle.value,
  ogTitle: () => dynamicTitle.value,
})
</script>

```


This previously used the [`useServerSeoMeta`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-server-seo-meta) composable, but it has been deprecated in favor of this approach.
