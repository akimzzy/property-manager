Registers a runtime hook in a Nuxt application and ensures it is properly disposed of when the scope is destroyed.

This composable is available in Nuxt v3.14+.

signature

```
function useRuntimeHook<THookName extends keyof RuntimeNuxtHooks>(
  name: THookName,
  fn: RuntimeNuxtHooks[THookName] extends HookCallback ? RuntimeNuxtHooks[THookName] : never
): void

```


### [Parameters](#parameters)

*   `name`: The name of the runtime hook to register. You can see the full list of [runtime Nuxt hooks here](about:/docs/api/advanced/hooks#app-hooks-runtime).
*   `fn`: The callback function to execute when the hook is triggered. The function signature varies based on the hook name.

### [Returns](#returns)

The composable doesn't return a value, but it automatically unregisters the hook when the component's scope is destroyed.

```
<script setup lang="ts">
// Register a hook that runs every time a link is prefetched, but which will be
// automatically cleaned up (and not called again) when the component is unmounted

useRuntimeHook('link:prefetch', (
link) => {
  
console.
log('Prefetching', 
link)
})
</script>

```
